# pxt-heading

## Introduction
Microbit makes a great controller for a robot buggy. But every vehicle ideally needs to know which way it's pointing. 

If you know exactly how far each wheel has rotated, then from their diameter you can compute the difference 
in path-lengths. Knowing the axle-length then lets you compute changes of direction. However, only a few 
buggies have rotation sensors...

A rather simpler method is just to use a compass! The problem is that the built-in microbit compass expects to operate
when it is horizontal, yet most robot buggies mount it vertically. It also asks to be calibrated by tilting it in every 
possible direction, potentially a rather awkward operation with a buggy!

This pxt-heading extension is designed to meet the need for a location-independent and orientation-independent compass,
based solely on the magnetometer readings. The magnetometer does still need to be calibrated (to discover how it 
sees its magnetic environment), but we achieve that simply by spinning the buggy on the spot for a couple of rotations, 
and then teaching it where North is.

## Earth's Magnetic Field
A simplified view is that the earth's magnetic field loops round from the magnetic South pole towards the magnetic North 
pole. Because the field is generated by circulation currents in the earth's liquid iron core, the situation is much more complicated, and these poles are gradually 
wandering. A decade ago, the Magnetic north pole was situated in northern Canada, some 500km from the true pole; it is 
currently heading for Siberia at around 50 km per year! So in reality a compass seldom points North, but it can be relied on to change only slowly.

In the southern hemisphere the field-vector points up out of the ground, and for the northern hemisphere it points down 
into the ground; near the Equator it is roughly horizontal. The magnetometer reads the field strength in three independent directions (X, Y & Z): the dimensions of a 3D box with the magnetic field vector as its diagonal. 

## Magnetometer Calibration
While calibrating, imagine the situation from the perspective of our spinning buggy.
As the buggy spins clockwise, the end of the magnetic field-vector sweeps out an anti-clockwise Spin-Circle. When the spin-axis neatly aligns with a magnetometer axis, this Spin-Circle projects squarely at right-angles to it, resulting in simple sine-wave readings in the other two axes.
    But in the fully general case, where the microbit is off-axis to the rotation, the Spin-Circle projects onto the plane of each pair of orthogonal axes (XY,YZ,ZX) 
    as an Ellipse with a certain eccentricity (and maybe a tilt). We will always get the best heading 
    discrimination from the "roundest", most "square-on" view (i.e. the least eccentric Ellipse).
    
    Taking readings from just those two axes, we'll need to transform points lying around the Ellipse 
    (by first rotating about the origin, and then scaling vertically to "un-squash" the Ellipse), so that 
    they lie back on the original Spin-Circle, giving a relative angle that can (eventually) be offset 
    by a fixed bias to return the true heading with respect to magnetic North. 

*******

As we spin around, successive measured points will then trace out a circle on the sphere with a diameter ranging from 
tiny (in polar regions where the field is more vertical), to the full diameter of the sphere (when we are near 
the earth's equator and the field is horizontal). We'll call this circle the Spin-Circle.

Although the magnetometer provides three readings (X,Y & Z), we will only need to use two of them to get our 
heading angle; the challenge is to choose the best two for the job! 

if the microbit is mounted squarely in the buggy, the axis of the Spin-Circle will be neatly aligned with whichever
magnetometer axis is pointing "up". The readings of the remaining two axes can then be easily interpreted to give 
us the heading angle. 

However, in the fully general situation where the microbit might be mounted on a slant, the Spin-Circle appears 
tilted into an Ellipse when looking down any axis onto the plane of the other two axes (XY,YZ or ZX).
Each Ellipse will in general show a different eccentricity, and we will obtain the best heading discrimination by 
choosing the projection plane showing the least eccentric (i.e most nearly circular) Ellipse. 

(Some systems just use an accelerometer to tell which way is "up", but this can only be trusted if the buggy is 
guaranteed to be completely at rest when you measure.) 

Having selected the best view to use, we'll need to transform each new reading from around the Ellipse, back onto 
a true circle. This can require up to three transformation steps:

* first we will generally need to shift it, effectively moving the Ellipse's centre to the origin; 

* if we are unlucky and the Ellipse appears tilted, we may then have to rotate it to lie squarely over the axes;

* finally we must scale one value in propotion to the eccentricity (so stretching the Ellipse back into a perfect circle).

Applying simple trigonometry to the final position on the circle gives us a relative angle which can then be adjusted
by a known offset to return the true heading with repect to magnetic North.

## Field Distortions
So much for the theory! In the real world there are several factors which conspire to distort the actual field as 
measured by the magnetometer. These can include:

* Environmental magnetic anomalies, due to magnets or electrical machinery near where the buggy is being used.

* Electro-magnetic fields due to flowing currents (especially powering the buggy's motors).

* Fixed metalwork and static motor magnets on the buggy itself, if they lie close to the microbit mounting-point. 
These will add (or subtract) a different fixed bias for each axis.

* "Jitter". Even when nothing has changed, repeated readings from the magnetometer often tend to differ.

We can only really account for the last two of these: Spinning the buggy lets us separate the local and environmental
influences and so calculate the fixed biases to be applied to each axis reading. Additionally, to smooth out any jitter,
we always use a rolling average of seven consecutive readings.

Unfortunately, the other factors lie outside our control, and will inevitably limit the accuracy and repeatability
of reported headings.

## heading.scan()
It is obviously not feasible for this extension to know how to turn every buggy in any particular direction, so you 
must first set it spinning on-the-spot (by running its motors in opposite directions) and then call the heading.scan() 
function to perform a magnetic scan of 3-D readings. The scanning time specified should be sufficient to complete at least
two full rotations.

## heading.setNorth()
Because this extension can't know just how the microbit is mounted your particular buggy, you need to point it towards 
North and then call this function (after first performing a heading.scan()) to register that direction as zero degrees. 
It will analyse the data collected during the scan to choose the best axes and how to calibrate them.

As an interesting by-product, it will return the spin-rate (in RPM) of the buggy during its latest scan, letting 
you compare the effects of setting different motor speeds.

## heading.degrees()
Having performed the scan using heading.scan(), and calibrated the measuring set-up using heading.setNorth(), 
this is the function that returns the current compass heading in degrees (0 to 360)

## rpm2Speed(diameter, axle)
A utility function to help with motor calibration. This function converts the spin-rate kin RPM) achieved with wheels turning 
in opposite directions, into the equivalent linear speed (in cm/sec) when both wheels are going forwards. Calculations are based 
on the wheel-diameter and axle-length (in cm). 

NOTE: It should be noted that motor calibration using this technique can only ever be approximate. 
For a given power setting, inertial and frictional effects may mean that the actual 
wheel-rotation speeds achieved will differ between moving forwards, and spinning on the spot.
Also, for low power settings, some buggies may automatically give an initial "kick" to get the motor going!
